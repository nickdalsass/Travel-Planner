This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Setting up Supabase for this project

@MyTeam Be sure to create a local environment file with the project url and project API key so you can access the endpoints locally!

## Setting up ESLint & Prettier for this project

@MyTeam If you are using VSCode, we will be using ESLint and Prettier for formatting, these can be easily downloaded in the Extensions Tab.

## Variable Naming and Other Formatting Practices

@MyTeam Please use camelCase variable naming! The only exception is when writing SQL queries (the attribute names have underscores i.e. trip_name, trip_location, etc.)

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.
